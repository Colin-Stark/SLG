# Week 4: Paths and Globbing
In this lesson, we focus on understanding directory navigation and relative paths in a Unix-based environment. You will learn how to manipulate the file system using paths and issue commands that make use of relative and absolute references. This knowledge is crucial for efficiently working with files and directories, particularly when dealing with complex folder structures.

We will use a predefined directory structure to test your understanding of how to move between directories, create files, and navigate efficiently within a hierarchical file system.

# Questions:
1. Create this tree in a folder called Seneca on Matrix with just one command?

2. What command would you use to move to the newnham directory from the markham directory?

3. If you're in the york directory, what command would move you to the campus directory?

4. How would you navigate from the final.txt file to the fall directory in a single command?

5. From the term/winter directory, how would you move to the labs.pdf file?

6. In which directory would you be if you ran cd .. after being inside studyweek?

7. If you are in term/summer, what command would take you to the markham directory?

8. How would you create a new file named project.txt inside the winter directory while in the york directory?

9. If you are inside the grading directory, how would you move directly to the king directory?

10. How would you list all the files inside the term directory from the campus/newnham directory?

11. You are in the final.txt file's directory. How do you navigate to the york directory without using an absolute path?

12. If you are in the studyweek directory, how would you move to the term/summer directory?

13. What command would take you from the winter directory to the labs.pdf file?

14. You are in the markham directory. How do you list the contents of the grading directory without changing your current directory?

15. If you're in the grading directory, what command would you use to create a new directory called assignments inside the fall directory?

Conclusion
These questions are designed to test your ability to use Unix path structures efficiently. Be sure to practice navigating through different directories using both relative and absolute paths. Mastery of these concepts is essential for command-line proficiency in any Unix-like environment.
