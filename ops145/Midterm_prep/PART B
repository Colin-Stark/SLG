## Create this directory in one command.

### Copying Files

1. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/practice/examples`  
   **Copy `command1.txt` from the `commands` directory to the `examples` directory using an absolute path.**  


2. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/practice/commands`  
   **Copy `lesson1.txt` from the `notes/lesson1` directory to the `notes/lesson2` directory using a relative path.**  
   

3. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/notes/lesson2`  
   **Copy `example1.txt` from the `commands` directory to the `examples` directory using an absolute path.**  
   

4. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/practice/notes`  
   **Copy `lesson2.txt` from the `notes/lesson2` directory to the `commands` directory using a home path.**  


5. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/notes/lesson1`  
   **Copy `example2.txt` from the `commands` directory to the `examples` directory using a relative path.**  
   

### Moving Files

6. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/notes/lesson1`  
   **Move `command2.txt` from the `examples` directory to the `commands` directory using an absolute path.**  
   

7. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/practice/commands`  
   **Move `lesson1.txt` from the `notes/lesson1` directory to the `examples` directory using a relative path.**  
  

8. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/practice/examples`  
   **Move `example3.txt` from the `examples` directory to the `lesson1` directory using an absolute path.**  
   

9. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/practice/examples`  
   **Move `example4.txt` from the `commands` directory to the `notes/lesson2` directory using a home path.**  
   

10. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/practice/commands`  
    **Move `lesson2.txt` from `notes/lesson2` to `examples` using a relative path.**  
    

### Removing Files

11. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/notes/lesson2`  
    **Remove `command3.txt` from the `commands` directory using an absolute path.**  
    

12. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/practice/examples`  
    **Remove `lesson1_old.txt` from the `notes/lesson1` directory using a relative path.**  
    

13. You are in `~/slg/tutorial3/practice/commands`
